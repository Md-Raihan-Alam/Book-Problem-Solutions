The main distadvantages is the having a bunch of classes extending one class becomes disorganized.
As it lowers the efficency of developers and their ability to optimise code as it can be less performant 
because it is harder to optimise.
The most important CPU performance to worry is about time complexity but more often the developer efficiency which
will cost in the long run
Also, if there is a method signature that is overridden in each class, the compiler will take longer to sort out or
 determine which method is overridden. but only methdos which call super are the ones you add. i.e. the more levels 
 you add the less like you need to override a method at every level.
