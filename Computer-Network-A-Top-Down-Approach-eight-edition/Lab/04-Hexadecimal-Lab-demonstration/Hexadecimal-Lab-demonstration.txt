1. First take 3650-24PS from switch , PC(PC0) from end device, Laptop(Laptop0) from end devices, now take Copper Staight-Through from connections and connect PC as FastEthernet0 and connect with switch 1/0/1 then take another from connection and connect with switch as 1/0/2 and connect with Laptop as FastEthernet0 and topology completed

2. Now go to PC0 Config by clicking on it, and click FastEthernet0 and set up IP4 address as 10.1.1.1 and subnet mask as 255.255.255.0, I can see the mac address of pc there. I can see the details of IP,Subnet and MAC typing 'ipconfig' or 'ipconfig /all' in command prompt in desktop

3. Now go to Laptop0 Config by clicking on it, and click FastEthernet0 and set up IP4 address as 10.1.1.2 and subnet mask as 255.255.255.0, I can see the mac address of pc there. I can see the details of IP,Subnet and MAC typing 'ipconfig' or 'ipconfig /all' in command prompt in desktop

4. See in PC0, Laptop0 command prompt 'ipconfig /all' and see for PC0 the physcial address(mac address) start with 0001 and for laptop it is 00D0 , the first half of address is vendor code, and second half is  unique identifier. but If I type 'arp -a' , see that no arp entries. Arp is used to find the mac adress of another device in the network, basically a broadcast who has this ip address and target device will sent back by with its mac address

5. Now ping the PC0 using 'ping 10.1.1.1' in laptop and connection will be establish now do 'arp -a' I will get the mac address of the pc, so pc and laptop has learn the mac address of each other, I can check in pc by typing 'arp -a'

6. Now go to CLI in switch by clicking on it, first return if needed then type 'en' to english and type 'show mac address-table' , I can see the switch has learn both devices mac address and other details

7. mac address consist of 6 hexadecimal values for vendor code and 6 hexadecimal for unique identifier and a hex value is 4 binary bits, so total 48 binary number is mac address. I can test by changing mac address of devies and see that arp is empty so, ping again and check arp -a , I can see that table in switch is updated and contain new mac address with old one, 

so I can see mac address is made of hexa decimal, hexadecimal is also used for ip6 and DHCPv6 and bluetooth physical
