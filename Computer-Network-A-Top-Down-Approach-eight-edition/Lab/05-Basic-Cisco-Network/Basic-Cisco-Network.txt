1. In network devices add 4321 router to topology and add another 4321 router.

2. In switches, add 3650 switch.

3. In connection, select copper cross-over, add to first 4321 router as giga 0/0/0
and add it to 3650 switch as giga 1/0/1 and now select another copper corss-ver and add to second 4321 router and select giga 0/0/0 and add to swithc giga 1/0/2, in simple terms select the first ones.

4. the interface is down because power if off, so select switch go to physical ac-power-supply, drag and add it and I can see switch being booted at cli and color will changed when I will enable the port at router, so I need to do it by using no shutdown command, now for now see the cli in switch, if I type 'yes' I will get through inital configuration, and I will be asked bunch of question, the answer is given below, I can understand the question ok,
	basic setup:yes
	switch name:S1,
	secret :cisco,
	enable password:cisco1,
	terminal password:cisco,
	snmp netowork:no,
I should see bunch of interfaces, I will be asked to enter the interface name used to connect to management network from givens: GigabitEthernet1/1/4
now configure ip on this inteface: no,
enter selection:0
and now perss enter, DONE. -> not good for real world

5. now cick router, go to cli, enter "no". now enter "enable" for enable then enter "conf t" for global configuration mode and then type "interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0",( the interface depends on device , a trick is type "show ip int brief" to show interface on router, "end" to go to privigaes mode, and shortcut is ="int g0/0/0" which is "interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0"). now type "ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0" and press enter, now type "no shutdown" and down and type "exit" and type "hostname R1" and type "end" and type "copy running-config startup-config" to save router configuaration and DONE.
6. similal for second router, host is R2, and interface is "inteface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0", "ip address 10.1.1.2 255.255.255.0", now all router is green and orange( for switch wait 30 sec to go green), on router 1 ping router 2, "ping 10.1.1.2", now on router 1 "ping 10.1.1.1" in cli

and basic cisco network is created
