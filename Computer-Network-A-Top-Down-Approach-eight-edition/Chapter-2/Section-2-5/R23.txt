An overlay network is a computer network built on top of an existing network. It consists of a virtual or logical network that is
 created using software and runs on top of the underlying physical network

The overlay network itself, in its logical or virtual form, does not necessarily include traditional routers. Overlay networks are typically built on top of the existing physical 
 network infrastructure, and their design focuses on end-to-end communication between nodes (end systems or hosts) rather than involving intermediate routers in the overlay.
While the overlay network may not directly include routers, the routers in the underlying physical network are still responsible for forwarding packets between overlay nodes. The 
communication within the overlay network is often facilitated through tunneling techniques, where the overlay packets are encapsulated within the packets of the underlying network.
 Routers in the physical network handle the routing of these encapsulated packets based on their own routing tables.

 In the context of an overlay network, the edges refer to the logical connections or links between nodes in the overlay. These edges represent the paths along which information or 
 data can be exchanged between nodes. Each edge in the overlay network connects two nodes, indicating a potential communication link between them.
