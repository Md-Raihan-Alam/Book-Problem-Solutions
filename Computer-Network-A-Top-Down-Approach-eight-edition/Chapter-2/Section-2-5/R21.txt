Bob will return the favor if he receives higher bit from Alice, if not then he will not provide chuncks to Alice in same interval

In the BitTorrent protocol, the concept of "tit-for-tat" is employed. If Alice provides chunks to Bob, Bob is more likely to reciprocate and 
provide chunks to Alice. However, it's not solely based on whether Bob received higher bits from Alice.

In BitTorrent, peers prioritize sharing with those who have shared with them. The more a peer contributes to others, the more likely it is to receive data in return. This cooperative 
behavior helps in efficient and fair distribution of the file among peers in the BitTorrent network.
