The network architecture and application architecture is different.

The network architecture contains Transport, Network, Data Link and Phsical. The network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of services to applications.

The application architecture, on the other hand, is designed by the application developer and dictates how the application is structured over the various end system. Usually two predominant
architecture is used, client-server architecture and peer-to-peer architecture. In the client-server architecture, there is an always-on host, called ther server, which services requests from many other
hosts, called clients. In peer-to-peer architecture, there is minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated servers in data centers. Instead the application exploits direct communication between pairs of
intermittently connected hosts, called peers.

So, the network architecture encompasses not only the layers but also the overall design and structure of a network, and application architecture encompasses not only the client-server 
and peer-to-peer models but also the design of software applications.
