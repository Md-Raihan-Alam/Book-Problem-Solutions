Four broad classes that a transport protocol can provide are reliable data transfer, throughput, timing and security.

1. Reliable data transfer: Packets can get lost within a coputer network. For example, a packet can overflow a buffer in a router , or can be discarded by a host or router after having some of tis bits corrupter.
                           So we need a protocol that can provide a guaranteed data delivery service, it is said to provide reliable data transfer, TCP provide it but UDP does not.
2. Throughput: Throughput, by which mean, in the context of a communication session between two processes alogn a network path, is the rate at which the sending process can deliver bits to the receiving process. 
                as there will be many session that will be suign same network path, the available throughput can fluctuate with time, So we need a service so that application could request a guaranteed througput of 
                r bits/sec. and there are such services and application that have throughput requirement , which are said to be bandwidth-sensitiveapplications. TCP and UDP both provides it.
3. Timing: A transport-layer protocol can also provide timing guarantees, as some application might be time sensitive and some might be less time sensitive. TCP and UDP both provides it.
4. Security: A transport protocol can provide an application with one or more security services, so that the packets can be encrypted, TCP provide TLS for it but UDP does not provide any.
