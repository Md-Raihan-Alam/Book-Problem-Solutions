In a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) client-server application, the server program must be executed before the client program. This is because the server needs to establish a 
listening socket, bind it to a specific IP address and port, and be ready to accept incoming connections. The client program, once the server is running, can then establish a 
connection with the server.

On the other hand, in a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) client-server application, the client program may be executed before the server program. UDP is connectionless, and clients can 
send datagrams to the server without the server actively listening for connections. The server, when it runs, can process incoming datagrams from any client, making the order of 
execution less critical in UDP compared to TCP.
