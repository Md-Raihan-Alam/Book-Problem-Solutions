When a user contacts a e-commerce site from his PC,  the request comes into the Site web server, the server creates a unique identification
number and creates an entry in its back-end database that is indexed by the identification number. Thw site web server then responds to user browser, including in the HTTP response a Set-cookie header which contains the 
identification number. When user's browser receives the HTTP response message, it sees the Set-cookie header. Thw broswer then appends a line to the special cookie file that it manages.
This line include the hostname of the server and the identification number in the Set-cookie header. Note that the cookie file already has an entry for site, since user has visited that site in the past,
As user continues to browse tha site, each tiem she requests a web pagem his broswer consults his cookie file, extracts his identification number for this site and puts a cookie header line that 
includes the identification number int he HTTP request. In this manner the site server is able to track user activity at the e commerce site, even if the site do not know ther user,
it knows exactly which page the user with specific identification cookies has visited
