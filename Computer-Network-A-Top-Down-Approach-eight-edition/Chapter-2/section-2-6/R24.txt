Content Distribution Netowkr typicaly adopt one of two different server placement philosphies.
1. Enter Deep: One philosophy, pioneeded by Akamai, is to enter deep into the acces networks of Intenet Service Providers, by deploying server clusters in access
ISP's all over the world. Akamai takes this approach with cluster in thousands oflocation. The goal is to get close to end users, thereby improving user-perceived delay
and throughput by decreasing the number of links and routes between the end  user and the CDN server from which it receives content. Because of this highly 
distributed design, the task of maintaining and managing the clusters becomes challenging.
2. Bring Home" A second design philosphy, taken by Limelight and manu other CDN companies, is to bring the ISPs home by building large clusters at a smaller number of sites.
Instead of getting inside the access ISPs, tehse CDNs typically place their clusters inInternet Exchange Points. Compared with
the enter-deep design philosophy, the bring-home design typically results inlower maintenance and managment overhead, possibly at the expense of higher delay and lower throughput
to end users.
