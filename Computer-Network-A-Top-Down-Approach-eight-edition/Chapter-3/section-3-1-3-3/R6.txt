Yes. It is possible for an application to enjoy reliable data transfer even when it runs over UDP(User Datagram Protocl), which is a connectionless
transport protocol that does not provide any guarantess for reliable data transmission.
One way to achieve reliable data transfer over UDP is by implementing the reliability mechanism at the application layer.
For example, the application can user acknowldegments, retransmission, and sequence numbers to ensure that all data is delivered reliably to the receiver.
This aproach is often used in real-time applications, such as online gaming and video streaming, where a small amount of packet loss or delay
can have a significant impact on the user experience.

Another approach is to use a reliable UDP (RUDP) protocol, which is a modified version of UDP that provides reliable data transfer. RUDP adds reliability mechanisms, such as acknowledgments and 
retransmissions, to ensure that data is delivered reliably to the receiver. RUDP is commonly used in applications that require low latency and high throughput, such as online gaming, voice over IP (VoIP),
and streaming media.
