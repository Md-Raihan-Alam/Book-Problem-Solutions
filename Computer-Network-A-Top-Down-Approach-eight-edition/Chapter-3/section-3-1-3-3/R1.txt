a=>Call this protocol Simple Transport Protocol (STP). At the sender side, STP accepts from the sending process a chunk of data not exceeding 1196 bytes, 
a destination host address, and a destination port number. STP adds a four- byte header to each chunk and puts the port number of the destination process in this header. 
STP then gives the destination host address and the resulting segment to the network layer. The network layer delivers the segment to STP at the destination host. STP then
 examines the port number in the segment, extracts the data from the segment, and passes the data to the process identified by the port number.
b=>The segment now has two header fields: a source port field and destination port field. At the sender side, STP accepts a chunk of data not exceeding 1192 bytes, 
a destination host address, a source port number, and a destination port number. STP creates a segment which contains the application data, source port number, and 
destination port number. It then gives the segment and the destination host address to the network layer. After receiving the segment, STP at the receiving host gives the
 application process the application data and the source port number. 
c=>No, the transport layer does not have to do anything in the core; the transport layer "lives" in the end systems.
