a.Given,
    First Segment=90
    Second Segment=110
    Data in the first segment=110-90=20
b. Consider the first segment is lost but second segment arrives at B. In the acknowldegment that Host B sends to Host A, then the acknowldegment number will be first 
segment of sequence number, that is 90.When Host B receives the second segment with sequence number 110, it will send an acknowledgment with an acknowledgment number 
equal to the next expected sequence number, which is 91. The acknowledgment number indicates the sequence number of the next byte that Host B is expecting to receive. 
Since the first segment with sequence number 90 was lost, Host B will assume that the next byte it expects to receive is byte 90, which is the first byte of the lost 
segment. Therefore, the acknowledgment number  in the acknowledgment sent by Host B to Host A will be 90.
