Some of the physical media that Ethernet can run over are:

1.Twisted-Pair Copper Wire: It is the most least expensive and commonly used. Twisted-pair copper wire consists of two insulated copper wires, each 1mm thick and arranged in a
                            regular spiral pattern. The wires are twisted together to reduce the electrical interferences from similar pairs clse by. Typically, a number of
                            pairs are bundled together in a cable by wrapping the pairs in a protective shield. A wired pair constitutes a single communication link. Unshielded
                            twisted pair(UTP) is commonly used for computer networks within a building. Data rates can be 10Mbps to 10Gbps

2.Coaxical Cable: Like the twisted-pair copper wire, the coaxical cable consist of two copper conductors, but the two conductors are concentric rather than parallel. With this construction
                  and special insulcation and shielding, the coaxical cable can achieve high datat transmission rates. It is commonly used in cable television system and it is
                  shared medium.

3. Fiber Optics: An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of light, with each pulse representing a bit. A single opical fiber can support tremendouse bit rates,
                 up to tens or even hundreds of gigabytes per second. They are immune to electromagnetice interfaces, have a very low attenuatio up to 100 kilometers and are very hard
                 to tap.
