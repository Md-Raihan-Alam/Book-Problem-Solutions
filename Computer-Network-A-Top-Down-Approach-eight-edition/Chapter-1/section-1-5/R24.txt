Application-layer message: An application-layer protocl is distributed over multiplle end system, witht the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of 
                            information with application in aonother end system. the packet of information at the applciation layer is refer as applicaiton-layer message.
Transport-layer segment: When the packets of information reached the transport layer, the transport layer takes the message and appends additional information that will be sued by the receiver
                         side tranport layer. The application-layer message and the transport layer header information together constitute the transport layer segment.
Network-layer datagram: When the transport-layer segment reached network layer, the network layer then adds network-layer header information such as source and destination end system addresses,
                        crating a network-layer datagram.
Link-layer frame: From network layer ,the datagram then reached to link layer where link layer will add its own header information and create a link layer fram.
