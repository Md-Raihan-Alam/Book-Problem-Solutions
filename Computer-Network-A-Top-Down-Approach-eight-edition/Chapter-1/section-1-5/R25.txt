A router processes data at both the network layer (Layer 3) and the link layer (Layer 2). At the network layer, it examines the destination IP address to make routing decisions. 
At the link layer, it handles the framing and forwarding of data frames within the local network segment.

A link layer switch primarily operates at the link layer (Layer 2). It deals with the MAC addresses in data frames and performs switching within the local network segment based on 
MAC address tables.

A host, such as a computer or a networked device, processes data at multiple layers, depending on its role and the tasks it performs. Typically, hosts operate at the application 
layer (Layer 7) when running network applications (e.g., web browsers), the transport layer (Layer 4) when establishing connections, and the network layer (Layer 3) when sending 
and receiving IP packets. The link layer (Layer 2) is responsible for handling data frames within the host's network interface.
