An end system creates packet by turning the file into data segments or break the file data into smaller units, these smaller units are known as
packets. The packet contain an header which contain its destination mac address or ip address or location, when it arrives on router, it checks 
the location in header and route it to correct location, as router give direction to final destination so it is analogous to driving from one city 
to another and asking direction along the way.
