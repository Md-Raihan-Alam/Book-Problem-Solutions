a->for first link, the file transfer will be 500000 bytes per second, second link, file transfer will be  2000000 bytes per second , third link, file transfer will be 
   1000000 bytes per second
b->the file size is 4000000 bytes, so for first link time will be 8 sec, for second link time will be 2 sec, for third link time will be 4 sec, so total time will be 14 sec
