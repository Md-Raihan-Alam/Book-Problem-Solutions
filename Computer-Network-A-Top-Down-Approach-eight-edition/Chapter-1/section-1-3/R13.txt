a->When circuit switching is used, wo users can be supported, the sender and the reciever.
b->Here link is 2Mbps, each users transmits continuously at 1 Mbps when tranmitting. so for the packet to go from sender to switch, it will be 2/1=2 and from switch to receiver
   2/1=2, so as it takes only 1 Mbps so most for two users it will be 2*1=2 Mbps, so there won't be any delay but when the is three then it become 3*1=3 so there will be qeuing delay.
c->Each user transmits only 20 percent of the time, which means they are active 20 percent of the time.The probability that a given user is transmitting is equal to the fraction 
   of time they are active, which is 20 percent or 0.2.
d->Each user transmits independently with a 20 percent probability of being active at any given time.To find the probability that all three users are transmitting simultaneously,
   we multiply their individual probabilities of being active because the events are independent.Probability of all three users transmitting 
   simultaneously = (0.2) * (0.2) * (0.2) = 0.008 or 0.8 percent. We have established that when three users transmit simultaneously, the link capacity is exceeded, and packets 
   must wait in a queue.The fraction of time during which the queue grows is directly related to the probability that all three users are transmitting simultaneously, which we 
   calculated as 0.008 or 0.8 percent.Therefore, the fraction of time during which the queue grows is 0.008 or 0.8 percent of the total time.
