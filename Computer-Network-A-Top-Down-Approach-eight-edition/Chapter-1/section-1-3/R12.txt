The circuit-switch network has some advantages then packet-switch network, unlike packet switch network  circuit-switch if the following connection is possible, and check other routes
if one is unavailable, and the connection won't be disturbed in any way. It is more suitable for telephone or mobile communication

Packet switching has also some advantages than circuit-switch network, 1. it offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circui switching and 2. it is simpler, more  efficient and less
costly to implement than circuit switching.

TDM(Time-Division-Multiplexing) has some advantages over FDM(Frequency-Division Multiplexing) as in TDM time is divided into frames of fixed duration and each frame is divided into a fixed 
number of time slots and in FDM the frequency spectrum of a link is divided , here TDM saves a fixed amount of duration which FDM do not, and the duration belong to sender and receiver end.
