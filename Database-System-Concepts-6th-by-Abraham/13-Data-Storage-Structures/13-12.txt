In a sequential file organization, an overflow block is used even if there is only one overflow record for several reasons:

1. Consistency and Simplicity: Using an overflow block consistently, even for a single overflow record, simplifies the file organization and management. It ensures that the file structure remains uniform and that all overflow records are handled in the same way, regardless of the number.

2. Future Expansion: Using an overflow block for a single record anticipates future data growth. While there may be only one overflow record at the moment, the number of overflow records can increase over time as the file continues to grow. Having a standardized approach for handling overflow records simplifies file management as data volume increases.

3. Ease of Data Retrieval: By consistently using an overflow block, retrieval algorithms remain simple and consistent. Regardless of the number of overflow records, the algorithm for finding and accessing overflow data remains the same, reducing the complexity of file access and navigation.

4. Handling Variability: The number of overflow records can vary over time due to data insertion, updates, and deletions. Using an overflow block ensures that the file organization is capable of handling this variability without the need for frequent structural changes.

5. Consistent File Structure: Sequential files often have a fixed structure that simplifies data access and management. Using an overflow block maintains this fixed structure, which can be important for performance and predictability in file access.

In summary, using an overflow block, even for a single overflow record, is a design choice that provides consistency, simplicity, and future-proofing for handling overflow records in a sequential file organization. It simplifies file management and ensures that the file structure remains robust as data volume and the number of overflow records grow over time.
