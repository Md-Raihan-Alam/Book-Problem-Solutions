a=>Advantages:

Simplicity and Isolation: Each relation is stored in a separate file, which simplifies data management and ensures that changes or maintenance tasks for one relation do not affect others. It provides clear isolation between tables.

Ease of Backup and Recovery: Backing up and recovering individual relations is straightforward since each table is stored in a separate file. This approach simplifies data restoration in case of corruption or data loss.

Disadvantages:

Overhead: Storing each relation in a separate file can result in overhead due to file system management. This overhead can be significant when there are many relations, as each file requires metadata, storage allocation, and management.

Limited Query Optimization: When querying involves multiple relations, reading from multiple files can lead to increased I/O operations and slower query performance. Query optimization becomes more challenging.

Storing Multiple Relations in One File (Monolithic Approach):

b=>Advantages:

Reduced Overhead: Storing multiple relations in a single file reduces file system overhead compared to managing individual files. This approach can be more space-efficient, especially when dealing with many small tables.

Improved Query Performance: Queries that involve multiple relations can benefit from reduced I/O when the relations are stored together, promoting better query performance.

Disadvantages:

Complexity: Managing multiple relations within a single file can be complex, especially when the schema evolves over time. It may require a more sophisticated data management system.

Data Isolation: Data isolation is reduced because relations are combined in a single file. Changes or maintenance in one relation can impact others. This lack of isolation can make it more challenging to maintain data consistency.
