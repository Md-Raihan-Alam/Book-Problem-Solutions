For quickly finding out if a block is present in a large database buffer and identifying its location within the buffer, a common data structure used is a hash table or a hash map. 
Here's why a hash table is a suitable choice:

Fast Lookup Time: Hash tables provide constant-time average lookup time for a given key (in this case, the block identifier). This means that regardless of the buffer's size, the time 
it takes to determine if a block is in the buffer is relatively constant and does not depend on the buffer's size.

Space-Efficient: Hash tables only store key-value pairs, making them memory-efficient. For large database buffers, minimizing the memory overhead for data structures is essential. 
A hash table typically has a small memory footprint relative to the number of blocks it can manage.

Direct Addressing: Hash tables use a hashing function to directly map the block identifier to a location in the hash table. This enables quick access to the location of the block in 
the buffer without the need to search or iterate through the buffer.
