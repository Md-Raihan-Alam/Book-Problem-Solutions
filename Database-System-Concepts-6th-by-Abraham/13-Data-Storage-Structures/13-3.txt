To represent the "section" and "takes" relations with three sections, each containing five students, we can create example instances of these relations. The "multitable clustering" refers to storing these two relations together in a structured file. Here's an example of such an instance:

Section Relation:

SectionID | SectionName | Instructor
-----------------------------------
001      | Math101     | Mr. Smith
002      | History201  | Ms. Johnson
003      | Physics301  | Dr. Williams
```

Takes Relation:
StudentID | SectionID | Grade
-----------------------------
101       | 001      | A
102       | 001      | B
103       | 001      | C
104       | 001      | A
105       | 001      | B
106       | 002      | B
107       | 002      | A
108       | 002      | C
109       | 002      | A
110       | 002      | B
111       | 003      | A
112       | 003      | A
113       | 003      | B
114       | 003      | B
115       | 003      | A
```

In this example:

- The "section" relation has three sections, identified by "SectionID," each with a section name and an instructor's name.
- The "takes" relation stores information about students (identified by "StudentID") who have taken specific sections. It records the section they took and their grade in that section.

Now, for the "multitable clustering" file structure, you would typically have a structure where the data from both relations is stored in the same file, perhaps with a common key for reference, such as "SectionID" in this case. The specific file structure could vary depending on the database system used, but the concept is to store related data together for improved query performance and data management.
