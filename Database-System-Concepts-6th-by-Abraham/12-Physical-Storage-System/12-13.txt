For a write-intensive application where data loss cannot be afforded due to disk failure, you might consider the following strategies:

Redundancy: Use RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) configurations that provide data redundancy. RAID 1 (Mirroring) and RAID 5 (Striping with Parity) are commonly used for their balance of performance and redundancy.

Replication: Depending on the database system, you can set up master-slave or master-master replication where writes are copied from one disk to another in real-time.

Regular Backups: Schedule regular backups of your data. This could be full backups or incremental backups depending on the size of your data and the resources available.

Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): This is a strategy used by many databases where changes are written to a log before they are applied to the database. In case of a failure, the log can be replayed.

Use a Distributed Storage System: Distributed storage systems like Hadoop HDFS, Google Cloud Storage, or Amazon S3 automatically replicate data across multiple nodes, providing high availability and durability.
