Ensuring atomic block writes in RAID configurations, especially in the context of power failures, is critical to maintaining data integrity. Here are schemes for achieving atomic block writes in RAID Level 1 (mirroring) and RAID Level 5 (block interleaved, distributed parity) configurations:

a. RAID Level 1 (Mirroring):

In RAID Level 1 (mirroring), data is duplicated on two or more drives for redundancy. To achieve atomic block writes with mirroring, you can implement the following scheme:

1. Write to Both Mirrors Atomically:
   - When a write request is received, the data block is written simultaneously to both mirrored drives.
   - Use a two-phase commit approach to ensure that both writes succeed or fail together. If one write operation fails (e.g., due to a power failure), roll back both writes to maintain consistency.

2. Flag Partially Written Blocks:
   - Each block write should be accompanied by a flag or metadata that indicates whether the write operation was successful or not. This flag can be stored alongside the mirrored data.
   - If a power failure occurs during a write operation, the RAID controller can detect the partial write by checking the flag.

3. Recovery from Partial Writes:
   - During the recovery process after a power failure, the RAID controller can identify partially written blocks using the flags.
   - To recover, read the data from the mirror where the block was fully written and rewrite it to the mirror with the partial write.
   - Once the data is fully written to both mirrors, clear the flag to indicate that the block is consistent.

b. RAID Level 5 (Block Interleaved, Distributed Parity):

In RAID Level 5, data is striped across multiple drives with distributed parity for fault tolerance. Achieving atomic block writes in this configuration can be more complex but is still feasible:

1. Write Data and Parity Atomically:
   - Similar to RAID 1, implement a two-phase commit approach where both data and parity blocks are written atomically across the array.
   - When a write request is received, calculate the new parity block (XOR operation) and write both the data block and parity block together.

2. Flag Partially Written Blocks:
   - As in RAID 1, include flags or metadata alongside each block to indicate the success or failure of write operations.

3. Recovery from Partial Writes:
   - During recovery after a power failure, identify partially written blocks using the flags.
   - To recover, reconstruct the data from the existing data and parity blocks, then rewrite the affected data and parity blocks.
   - Once the data and parity are fully written and consistent, clear the flags.

4. Recovery Optimization:
   - For performance optimization during recovery, prioritize the recovery of parity blocks first to ensure the data's integrity in the event of a subsequent drive failure.
