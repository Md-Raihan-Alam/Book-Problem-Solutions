In terms of Cost-
    Using fewer disks in a RAID 5 array reduces the overall cost of the storage solution.
    Using more disks increaes the cost of the RAID 5 array due to the higher number of drives required.
In terms of Reliability-
    With fewer dists, the RAID 5 array has fewer components that could potentially fail.
    More disks mean a higher likelihood of drive failures within the array as the risk of enountering multiple 
    drive failers increases as the number of disks grows, potentially compromising data reliability.
In terms of Performance During Failure:
    with fewer disks in the event of a drive failure, RAID 5 performance may degrade to some extent, but the 
    impact is relatively lower with fewer disks. Rebuild times are shorter, minimizing the exposure to a degraded state.
    With more disks, the impact of a single drive failure on RAID 5 performance is generally more significant. Rebuild 
    times can be longer, increasing the risk of a second drive failure during the rebuild (a scenario known as the "RAID 5 write hole").
In terms of Performance During Rebuild:
    with fewer disks,Rebuilds in smaller RAID 5 arrays tend to be faster, as there is less data to reconstruct. This means that the array can 
    return to full redundancy and optimal performance more quickly. With more disks, larger RAID 5 arrays may experience longer rebuild times 
    due to the greater amount of data that needs to be reconstructed. This extended rebuild period can expose the array to potential vulnerabilities for a more extended duration.
