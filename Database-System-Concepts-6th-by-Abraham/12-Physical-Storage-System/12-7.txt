Reading data sequentially from a large file could be done with only one seek if the entire file were stored on consecutive disk blocks, Ensuring 
availability of large numbers of consecutive free blocks is not easy, since files are created and deleted, resulting in fragmentation of the free blocks is not easy,
since files are created and deleted, resulting in fragmentation of the free blocks on disk, Operating system's allocate blocks on large but fixed-sized
sequential extents instead, and only on seek is required per extent.
