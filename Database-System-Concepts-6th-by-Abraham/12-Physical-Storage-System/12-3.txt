a. Creating the Flash Translation Table (FTT) in Memory:
   - The Flash Translation Table (FTT) is used in flash storage to map logical page numbers to physical page numbers, allowing the flash controller to keep track of where data is stored within the NAND flash memory.
   - The FTT is typically created and maintained by the flash controller itself, not by the user or the operating system. It's part of the flash management firmware.
   - When data is initially written to the flash storage, the FTT records the mapping between logical page numbers (used by the file system or operating system) and physical page numbers within the NAND flash memory.

b. Size of the Flash Translation Table (FTT):
   - To determine the size of the FTT, you'll need to consider several factors:
     - Total flash storage capacity: 64 gigabytes
     - Page size: 4096 bytes
     - Address size per page: 32 bits
   
   - To calculate the size of the FTT in bytes, you can use the following formula:
        FTT size (in bytes) = Total flash capacity / Page size * Address size per page

   - Substituting the values:
        FTT size = (64 gigabytes / 4096 bytes) * 32 bits = 1 gigabyte


   So, the size of the FTT would be approximately 1 gigabyte.

c. Reducing the Size of the Translation Table:
   - To reduce the size of the translation table when long ranges of consecutive logical page numbers are mapped to consecutive physical page numbers, you can implement a technique called "block mapping" or "block translation."
   - In this approach, instead of maintaining a one-to-one mapping for each logical page to physical page, you group multiple logical pages into blocks, and each block is mapped to a consecutive range of physical pages.
   - For example, if you have a consecutive range of logical pages from 0 to 1000, they could be mapped to a single block of physical pages. This reduces the size of the translation table, as you only need one entry for the entire block instead of individual entries for each logical page.
   - Block mapping can be particularly effective in scenarios where data is organized into large, contiguous chunks, as it significantly reduces the FTT's memory overhead.
