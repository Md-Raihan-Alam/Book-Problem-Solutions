1. Inserting a Tuple:
   When attempting to insert the tuple (10111, Ostrom, Economics, 110,000) into the "instructor" table, it is essential to consider the foreign key constraint. The "instructor" table likely has a foreign key that references the "department" table, ensuring that the department_name attribute in the "instructor" table corresponds to a valid department_name in the "department" table. If the "department" table does not have a department named "Economics," the insertion will violate the foreign key constraint. This violation will prevent the insertion from being executed to maintain data integrity, as the foreign key constraint ensures that data in the "instructor" table is consistent and properly related to data in the "department" table.

2. Deleting a Tuple:
   When attempting to delete the tuple (Biology, Watson, 90000) from the "department" table, it's crucial to consider the foreign key constraint's impact. The "instructor" and "works" tables likely have foreign keys referencing the "department" table, ensuring that the department_name attribute in these tables corresponds to valid department names in the "department" table. If there are any associated tuples in the "instructor" or "works" tables with the department name "Biology," the deletion will violate the foreign key constraint. This violation will prevent the deletion from being executed to maintain data integrity, as the foreign key constraint ensures the consistency and integrity of relationships between tables in the database.
