The terms "relation" and "relation schema" are fundamental concepts in the context of relational databases. They refer to different aspects of organizing and representing data within a database system:

1. Relation:
A relation in a relational database refers to a specific table that stores data in rows and columns. Each row in the relation represents a single record or tuple, and each column represents an attribute or field. The relation can be visualized as a two-dimensional grid or table, where each cell holds a single data value corresponding to the intersection of a row and a column. The concept of a relation is closely related to the mathematical concept of a relation in set theory.

For example, consider a relation named "Employees" with attributes "EmployeeID," "Name," "Department," and "Salary." Each row in the "Employees" relation represents information about an individual employee, and each column represents specific attributes of the employees.

2. Relation Schema:
The relation schema, on the other hand, refers to the structure or blueprint of a relation without containing any actual data. It defines the attributes and their data types that a relation will have when populated with data. In other words, the relation schema defines the column names, data types, and any integrity constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key) associated with the relation.

Using the example of the "Employees" relation, the relation schema would be defined as follows:

Employees(EmployeeID: integer, Name: string, Department: string, Salary: decimal)

The relation schema tells us that the "Employees" relation will have four attributes: "EmployeeID," "Name," "Department," and "Salary." The data types are specified as well; "EmployeeID" is an integer, "Name" and "Department" are strings (text), and "Salary" is stored as a decimal number.

In summary, a relation represents the actual data stored in a table, while a relation schema describes the structure and attributes of that table without containing any data. The relation schema acts as a blueprint for creating the relation and defines the organization and data types of the data that will be stored in the relation.
