If the index entries are inserted in ascending order, the new entries get directed to the last leaf node.
When this leaf node gets filled, it is split into two, Of the two nodes generated by the split,
the left node is left untouched and the insertion takes place on the right node, This makes the occupancy of the
left nodes aobut 50 percent except for the last leaf.
If keys that are inserted are sorted indescending order, the above situation would still occur, but symmetrically, with the right
node of a split never getting rouched again, and occupancy would again be 50 percent for all nodes other than 
first leaf.
