Here are five ways in which the type declaration system of programming languages like Java or C++ differs from the data definition language used in databases:

1. Purpose:
   - Type Declaration in Programming Languages: The type declaration system in programming languages is used to define the types of variables, objects, and data structures within the code. It helps enforce type safety and enables the compiler to perform static type checking.
   - Data Definition Language (DDL) in Databases: The DDL is used to define and manage the structure of the database itself, including tables, indexes, constraints, and relationships. It focuses on the logical and physical organization of data, rather than specifying the types of individual data elements.

2. Granularity:
   - Type Declaration in Programming Languages: Programming languages allow you to define types at a fine-grained level, such as primitive types (integers, booleans), complex types (classes, structures), and user-defined types.
   - DDL in Databases: The DDL operates at a higher level, defining tables, columns, and constraints that encapsulate a larger set of related data. It deals with the structure and relationships between data elements rather than individual types.

3. Syntax and Expressiveness:
   - Type Declaration in Programming Languages: Programming languages provide a rich set of syntax and constructs to define and express complex types, including support for inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, generics, and more.
   - DDL in Databases: The syntax of DDL is specific to the database system being used and is focused on defining tables, columns, indexes, keys, constraints, and other database-specific objects.

4. Compilation vs. Execution:
   - Type Declaration in Programming Languages: Type declarations in programming languages are part of the source code and are checked by the compiler during the compilation process. Type errors are caught at compile-time before the program is executed.
   - DDL in Databases: DDL statements are executed directly against the database management system. The database schema is modified at runtime based on the DDL statements.

5. Evolution and Persistence:
   - Type Declaration in Programming Languages: In programming languages, the type declarations are typically part of the source code and can evolve over time as the codebase is modified. However, they may not persist beyond the execution of the program.
   - DDL in Databases: DDL statements define the structure of the database and its objects. Once executed, the database schema persists even after the program terminates, allowing for data persistence and subsequent data manipulation operations.

It's important to note that while there are differences between the type declaration system in programming languages and the data definition language in databases, they both play crucial roles in managing and organizing data within their respective domains.
