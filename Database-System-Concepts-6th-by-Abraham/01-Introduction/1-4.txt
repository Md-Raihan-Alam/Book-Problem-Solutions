   - Enrollment records: Courses enrolled, program of study, academic history, grades, credits earned, etc.
   - Financial information: Tuition fees, scholarships, payment records, financial aid, etc.

   - Employment records: Position, department, tenure status, salary, work schedule, etc.
   - Courses and teaching assignments: Courses taught, class schedules, grading, etc.
   - Research activities: Publications, grants, research projects, collaborations, etc.
   - Performance evaluations and feedback: Annual reviews, performance metrics, professional development, etc.

3. Course and Curriculum Information:
   - Course catalog: Course codes, titles, descriptions, prerequisites, credit hours, etc.
