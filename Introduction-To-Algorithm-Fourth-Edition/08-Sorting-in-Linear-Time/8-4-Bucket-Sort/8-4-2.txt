If all the keys fall in the same bucket and they happen to be in reverse order, we have to sort a single bucket with n items in reversed order with insertion sort. This is Î˜(n ^2).

We can use merge sort or heapsort to improve the worst-case running time. Insertion sort was chosen because it operates well on linked lists, which has optimal time and requires 
only constant extra space for short linked lists. If we use another sorting algorithm, we have to convert each list to an array, which might slow down the algorithm in practice.
