Real-world problem where only the best solution will do: 

Optimizing Airline Scheduling: In the airline industry, 
optimizing flight scheduling is crucial for maximizing 
efficiency and minimizing costs. Airlines need to 
determine the best allocation of flights to various 
aircraft, considering factors such as passenger demand,
crew availability, maintenance schedules, and airport 
slot constraints. In this case, only the best solution
that minimizes costs, maximizes aircraft utilization,
and ensures optimal passenger satisfaction will 
suffice. Any suboptimal solution may lead to inefficiencies, 
increased costs, and disruptions in the airline's operations.
