The smalles value of value of n has to be 15.(from program)

-> from internet
Trying n=20
 gives
10n=200
and
2n/2=210=1024.

Since the rate of increase of n↦10n
 is constant, while n↦2n/2
 grows more and more quickly for larger n,
 it follows that 10n<2n/2
 whenever n≥20,
 so we're looking for some n<20.

Trying n=14
 gives us
10n=140
and
2n/2=128,
so by similar reasoning, we need some n≥14
.

From there, the solution's fairly quickly found to be n=15
.

Note: n=15
 is not the solution to the equation 100n2=2n
, but it is the least n
 for which 100n2<2n
.
