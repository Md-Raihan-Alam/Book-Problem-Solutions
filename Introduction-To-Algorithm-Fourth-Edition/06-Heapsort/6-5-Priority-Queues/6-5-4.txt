MAX-HEAP-DECREASEKEY(A, x, k)
    if k > A[x]
        error "New key is greater than the current key"
    A[x] = k
    while x > 1 and A[PARENT(x)] < A[x]
        exchange A[x] with A[PARENT(x)]
        x = PARENT(x)
Time complexity of MAX-HEAP-DECREASEKEY O(log n), which ensures efficient maintenance of the max-heap property.
