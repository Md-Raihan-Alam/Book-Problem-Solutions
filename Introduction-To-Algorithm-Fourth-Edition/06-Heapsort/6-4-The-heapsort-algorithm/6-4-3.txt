Both of them are Θ(nlgn).If the array is sorted in increasing order, the algorithm will need to convert it to a heap that will take 
O(n). Afterwards, however, there are n−1 calls to MAX-HEAPIFY and each one will perform the full 
lgk operations. Since:
(n-1)Σ(k=1) lgk=lg((n-1)!)=Θ(nlgn)
Same goes for decreasing order. BUILD-MAX-HEAP will be faster (by a constant factor), but the 
computation time will be domincated by the loop in HEAPSORT, which is Θ(nlgn)
