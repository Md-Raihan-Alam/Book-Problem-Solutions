To show that each child of the root of an n-node heap is the root of a subtree containing at most 2n/3 nodes, we can use the properties of a max-heap (or min-heap). In a max-heap, for any given node, all the nodes in its subtrees have values less than or equal to the value of the node itself.

1. Each child of the root is either the left child or the right child. Let's consider the left child first.

2. The left child will be the largest element among all its children. So, the left child's subtree can contain at most n/3 elements (since there are two other subtrees).

3. Similarly, for the right child, it can also contain at most n/3 elements.

4. The root itself contains 1 element.

Now, if we add up the number of nodes in the root, left child's subtree, and right child's subtree, we get:

1 (root) + n/3 (left child's subtree) + n/3 (right child's subtree) = n/3 + n/3 + 1 = (2n/3) + 1

Since we're concerned with the maximum number of nodes in a child's subtree, we ignore the "+1" and just consider 2n/3. This shows that each child of the root contains a subtree with at most 2n/3 nodes.

Now, let's find the smallest constant α such that each subtree has at most αn nodes. In this case, α is 2/3.

The recurrence relation T(n) <= T(2n/3) + Θ(1) represents the time complexity of an operation on a data structure that exhibits this property. The recurrence relation means that when you perform an operation on a data structure with n nodes, you can break it down into two smaller operations on structures with at most (2/3)n nodes, and the cost of each operation is Θ(1).

You can solve this recurrence relation using the Master Theorem. The Master Theorem states that if T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), then the time complexity is:

- If f(n) = O(n^log_b(a - ε)), where ε > 0, then T(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a)).

- If f(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a)), then T(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a) * log n).

- If f(n) = Ω(n^log_b(a + ε)), where ε > 0, and if a*f(n/b) <= k*f(n) for some k < 1 and sufficiently large n, then T(n) = Θ(f(n)).

In your case, a = 1, b = 3/2, and f(n) = Θ(1). You can see that f(n) = Θ(1) is in the first case of the Master Theorem. Therefore, the solution is T(n) = Θ(n^log_(3/2)(1)).

Now, log_(3/2)(1) is 0 because 3/2^0 = 1. Therefore, T(n) = Θ(1).

This means that the time complexity of operations on this data structure is constant, which is very efficient. The fact that each subtree has at most 2/3n nodes doesn't significantly affect the recurrence relation or its solution because the constant factor in the Θ(1) term remains the same.
