The more sorted the array is , the less work insertion sort will do. Namely, insertion-sort is Î˜(n+d), where
d is the number of inversion in the array. In the example give the number of inversion tends to be samll so insertion sort will be close to linear.
On the other hand, if partition des pick a pivot that does no participate in an inversion, it will produc an empty partition.
Since there is a small number of inversion, quicksort is very likeyly to produc empty partitions.
