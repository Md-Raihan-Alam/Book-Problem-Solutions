In order to produce a worse split than 
1−α to α, PARTITION must pick a pivot that will be either within the smallest 
αn elements or the largest αn elements. The probability of either is (approximately) 
αn/n=α and the probability of both is 
2α. Thus, the probability of having a better partition is the complement, 1−2α.
