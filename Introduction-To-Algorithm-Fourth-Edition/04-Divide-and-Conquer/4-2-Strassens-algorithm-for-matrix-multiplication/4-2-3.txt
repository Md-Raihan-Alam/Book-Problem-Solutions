To determine the largest value of k such that I can multiply 3x3 matrices using k multiplications and then use this approach to multiply n×n matrices in O(n lg 7) time, I can utilize Strassen's algorithm as a reference point. Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication has a time complexity of approximately O(n^log2(7)), which is equivalent to O(n^2.807).

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. Strassen's algorithm for 3x3 matrix multiplication uses 7 multiplications, so k = 7 in this case.

2. I want to generalize this to n×n matrix multiplication and achieve a time complexity of O(n lg 7).

To achieve this, I can use a divide-and-conquer approach. Suppose I have a way to multiply 3x3 matrices using 7 multiplications. I can then recursively apply this approach to multiply larger matrices. Here's how I can do it:

- Given two n×n matrices A and B, divide them into 3x3 submatrices:
  A = | A11  A12  A13 |    B = | B11  B12  B13 |
      | A21  A22  A23 |        | B21  B22  B23 |
      | A31  A32  A33 |        | B31  B32  B33 |

- Compute the following products using the previously established method for 3x3 matrices:
  M1 = A11 * (B12 - B22)
  M2 = (A11 + A12) * B22
  M3 = (A21 + A22) * B11
  M4 = A22 * (B21 - B11)
  M5 = (A11 + A33) * (B11 + B33)
  M6 = (A12 - A22) * (B21 + B22)
  M7 = (A13 - A33) * (B31 + B32)

- Calculate the resulting n×n matrices using the above products:
  C11 = M5 + M4 - M2 + M6
  C12 = M1 + M2
  C21 = M3 + M4
  C22 = M5 + M1 - M3 - M7

- Combine these n×n submatrices to form the final product C.

Now, the recurrence relation for the time complexity of this approach is as follows:

T(n) = 7T(n/3) + O(n^2)

This is because I perform seven multiplications of n/3×n/3 matrices and some additional O(n^2) operations to combine the results. Using the Master Theorem, I can show that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^log3(7)), which is approximately O(n^1.7712).

So, if I can multiply 3x3 matrices using 7 multiplications, I can multiply n×n matrices in approximately O(n^1.7712) time, which is faster than the traditional O(n^2.807) time of Strassen's algorithm. However, it's not exactly O(n lg 7), but it's an improvement over the traditional matrix multiplication algorithm.
