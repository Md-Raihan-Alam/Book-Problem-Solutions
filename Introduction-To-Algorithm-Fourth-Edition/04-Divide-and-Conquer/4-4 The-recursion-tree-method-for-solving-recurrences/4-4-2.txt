To prove that the recurrence relation L(n) has an asymptotic lower bound of Ω(n) using the substitution method, we'll assume that L(n) is bounded from below by a constant times n. We'll then demonstrate that this assumption holds.

Assumption: Let's assume that L(n) is Ω(n), which means there exists a positive constant c such that L(n) ≥ c * n for all n greater than or equal to some n[0].

Now, let's verify this assumption using the recurrence relation:

Recurrence Relation:
L(n) = 1 if n < n[0] (base case)
L(n) = L(n/3) + L(2n/3) if n ≥ n[0]

We will use the substitution method to show that L(n) ≥ c * n for all n ≥ n[0].

1. Base Case: If n < n[0], we know L(n) = 1. Since 1 ≥ 1 * n for all n, the base case holds.

2. Inductive Step: For n ≥ n[0], assume that L(k) ≥ c * k holds for all k < n. We will prove that L(n) ≥ c * n.

L(n) = L(n/3) + L(2n/3)

By our inductive hypothesis, we know that L(n/3) ≥ c * (n/3) and L(2n/3) ≥ c * (2n/3) since n/3 < n and 2n/3 < n. Therefore:

L(n) = L(n/3) + L(2n/3) ≥ c * (n/3) + c * (2n/3)
L(n) = (c/3 + 2c/3) * n
L(n) = (3c/3) * n
L(n) = c * n

So, we've shown that if L(k) ≥ c * k for all k < n, then L(n) ≥ c * n, which means our assumption holds for n ≥ n[0].

Since we have shown that L(n) is bounded from below by c * n for all n ≥ n[0], we can conclude that L(n) is Ω(n).

Finally, because we have shown that L(n) is both Ω(n) and O(n) (previously), this implies that L(n) is Θ(n), meaning it is asymptotically equal to n.
