The function f(n) = 2^⌈lg n⌉ can be represented as follows:

f(n) = 2^⌈lg n⌉ = 2^(lg n + 1)

Now, let's consider the conditions for the master theorem:

a f(n/b) ≤ c f(n) for some constant c < 1.

   In this case, let's choose a = 1, b = 2, and c = 1/2.

   a f(n/b) = 1 * 2^(⌈lg (n/2)⌉) = 2^⌈lg n - 1⌉ = (1/2) * 2^(lg n + 1) = (1/2) * f(n).

   The condition a f(n/b) ≤ c f(n) is satisfied with c = 1/2.

f(n) should be a polynomially bounded function, but in this case, f(n) = 2^(lg n + 1) grows exponentially.

For any ε > 0, f(n) = Ω(n^(log_b(a+ε))):

   We have a = 1, b = 2, and f(n) = 2^(lg n + 1).

   n^(log_2(1+ε)) = n^(1+ε).

   If we choose ε = 1, then n^(log_2(1+ε)) = n^2, which is a polynomial bound, and f(n) = 2^(lg n + 1) grows faster than any polynomial. So, the condition in case 3 is satisfied for ε = 1.

In summary, the function f(n) = 2^⌈lg n⌉ satisfies all the conditions in case 3 of the master theorem except the regularity condition.
