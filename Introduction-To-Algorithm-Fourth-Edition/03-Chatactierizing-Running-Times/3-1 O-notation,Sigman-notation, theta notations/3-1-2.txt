this is the peudocode:
selectionSort(arr: array of elements)
    n = length(arr)
    for i = 0 to n - 2
        minIndex = i
        for j = i + 1 to n - 1
            if arr[j] < arr[minIndex]
                minIndex = j
            end if
        end for
        if minIndex â‰  i
            swap arr[i] and arr[minIndex]
        end if
    end for
end p
in line 4 the outer loop takes total time 0 to n-2 times, and in innner loop in line 6 the total time is i+1 to n-1 times.
so for average case, total loop takes (n-1)(n-2)(n-3)..+1 times so which is is like (n^2)/2 times.
in worst case scenario, all loop will run on (n^2)/2 time
in best case scenario, all loop will run on (n^2)/2 time
in average case scenario, all loop will run on(n^2)/2 time
In conclusion, the selection sort algorithm has a worst-case, best-case, and average-case time complexity of approximately O(n^2)
